"""Prompt-conditioned relevance split for KEEP/DROP compression decisions.

Segments tool output into coherent records, scores each against the request's
*information need* (user prompt + the triggering tool call's args) using the
existing :class:`~headroom.relevance.RelevanceScorer` (BM25 / bge-small
embeddings / hybrid), and partitions the content into ordered KEEP/DROP runs.

The split is **mode-agnostic**: this module decides *what* is worth keeping
verbatim vs. what is a low-value tail; the caller applies the disposition. In
lossless (no-CCR) mode the KEEP runs stay byte-verbatim and the DROP tail is
Kompressed marker-free; in CCR mode the same DROP tail can be dropped with a
retrieval marker. Nothing here emits markers or calls a compressor.

Segmentation is boundary-aware, not line-based: blank lines delimit records,
indented continuation lines stay attached to their parent (so stack traces and
pretty-printed blobs are scored as one unit), and dense blank-free streams
(grep, tight logs) are packed into small fixed windows. The partition is
lossless -- ``"".join(segment(content)) == content`` -- so KEEP runs
reconstruct the original bytes exactly.
